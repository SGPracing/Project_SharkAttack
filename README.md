# Project Shark Attack #

## Data ##
Source: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/ <br />
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks <br />

## Objectives
#### Primary: ####
* to verify if there is an obvious trend in the number of attacks per year in the last 10 years of collected data; <br />
* to determine the top 10 most dangerous areas and activities; <br />

#### Secondary: ####
* to find the acttack fatality rate for the top 10 activities (as a single variable) <br />

## Background ##
The dataset *attacks.csv* was sourced from the **Shark Research Institute**. The file contains extensive data, collected for centuries, about shark attacks in the entire World. The method of data collection is ignored, thus, inherent bias cannot be avoided. Moreover, there is significant data heterogeneity for most of the variables, in particular those necessary for the purpose of this study. 

## Methods ##
Targetted data cleaning and analysis was performed under *Python* and *Pandas*. The entire process was carefully worked in order to allow statistical analysis as accurate as possible.

## Results ##

#### Trend of attacks throughout the last 10 years ####
